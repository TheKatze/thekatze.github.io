    <div class="container">
        <p>i've been programming for a few years now and ive picked up some languages on the way like java, c#, c++(c), let's not talk about javascript though. i hate that abomination of a language.</p>
        <p>my first sad try at 'programming' were little calculator bash-scripts. soon i figured that bash script wouldn't meet my needs so i tried to look into java, which was way too complicated for me at the time.</p>
        <p>so a friend of me introduced me to DarkBasic, which is a weird language specifically for games. it works for its purpose but in retrospect i hate that language...</p>
        <p>then i went to htl dornbirn and i finally learnt java and c, which i enjoyed. i programmed little games together with my friends and everything was good</p>
        <p>we decided that we should give other programming languages a try, so we java people tried c#. it was the same. what did we expect? i dont know.</p>
        <p>then, one fateful day, i met the guy who introduced me to DarkBasic again and he introduced me to opengl/c++. what he showed me would change my life forever (not really). i instantly fell in love with pointers and still don't get them to this day.</p>
        <p>now i have had a few programming internships and i think im pretty ok at programming</p>

        <h2>i also try webdesign</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <p>shortly after i learnt bash i gave html a try (funny, that my first two 'programming languages' weren't programming languages), and made some horrible websites without css</p>
        <p>at htl dornbirn i then learnt how to do css and my websites went from shit to less shit (as you can see) </p>
